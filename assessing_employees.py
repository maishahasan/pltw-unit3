#  At a particular company, employees are rated at the end of each year. The rating scale
#  begins at 0.0, with higher values indicating better performance and resulting in larger
#  raises. The value awarded to an employee is either 0.0, 0.4, or 0.6 or more. Values
#  between 0.0 and 0.4, and between 0.4 and 0.6 are never used. The meaning associated
#  with each rating is shown in the following table. The amount of an employee’s raise
#  is $2400.00 multiplied by their rating.
#  Rating       Meaning
#  0.0          Unacceptable performance
#  0.4          Acceptable performance
#  0.6 or more  Meritorious performance
#  Write a program that reads a rating from the user and indicates whether the performance
#  was unacceptable, acceptable or meritorious. The amount of the employee’s
#  raise should also be reported. Your program should display an appropriate error
# message if an invalid rating is entered.
